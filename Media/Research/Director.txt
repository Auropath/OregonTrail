 * Iterate through 2-week trip segments
 * Play then proceeds through a series of up to 18 turns (each representing two weeks)
 * 20+ weeks (246 days) will trigger end game routine
 * Expected mileage for next two-weeks calculated with current stats
 * Mileage figure is ideal, problems subtract from this figure
 * Mileage printed at start of next trip segment
 * Average mileage is about 75 miles a week
 * The going gets slower and harder later in the trip
 * Weather changes, requiring more clothing
 * Stopping at a fort for supplies dramatically reduces the miles you can cover in a single turn
 * Bad weather occurs 20% of the time
 * Injuries 5% of the time
 * Detects where the player is on the trail and adjust random events
 * Snows in the mountains and river disasters occur on the plains

Your journey over the Oregon Trail takes place in 1847. Start.
ing in Independence, Missouri, you plan to take your family of
five over 2040 tough miles to Oregon City.

Having saved $420 for the trip, you bought a wagon for $70 and
now have to purchase the following items :

 * Oxen (spending more will buy you a larger and better team which
 will be faster so you'll be on the trail for less time)

 * Food (you'll need ample food to keep up your strength and health)

 * Ammunition ($1 buys a belt of 50 bullets. You'll need ammo for
 hunting and for fighting off attacks by bandits and animals)

 * Clothing (you'll need warm clothes, especially when you hit the
 snow and freezing weather in the mountains)
  
 * Other supplies (includes medicine, first-aid supplies, tools, and
 wagon parts for unexpected emergencies)
