*Banker has more money for supplies and services than a capenter or a farmer.
*The harder you have to try, the more points you deserve! So farmer gets the most and banker earns the least.
*Decide when to leave, earlier means less supplies, later means harsher environment, middle is just right.
*Equipment and supplies must be purchased. You have $800.00 in cash, no need to spend it all now.
